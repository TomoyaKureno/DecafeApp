# DecafeApp

The DecafeApp is a mobile application that can help the performance of a restaurant, cafe or diner in terms of transactions. This app can be used as a self-service food ordering application or a cashier application

## Getting Started

### Platform support
- Android phone and tablet
- iOS phone and tablet

The UI now uses adaptive text scaling and a compact-screen fallback layout, so it can run on smaller screens in addition to large tablets.

### Run locally
1. `flutter pub get`
2. Android: `flutter run -d android`
3. iOS (macOS only): `cd ios && pod install && cd .. && flutter run -d ios`
